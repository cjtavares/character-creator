# Character-creator

## Description


This site allows the users to select a character from three different genres. Once you select your character, or pick a character already generated in the database, you are asked a series of prompts that aid in building a story line template to your liking. The reason this project was created was to help aid creators when blockers, creative paralysis and or writers block occures. This site helps in pushing our users out of that paralysis muck and on the way to the creativity train.
